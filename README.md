### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
- **Mobile**: This app is uniquely mobile because people would like to plan what they watch on the go. We could use audio to play movie trailers and location to share where you want to watch movies with your friends
- **Story:** Since there is no social media app dedicated to talking about movies to your friends, the story of this app is very compelling. Our peers would respond well to this app idea since talking about movies is a common topic.
- **Market:** The market for this app is very large since it is everyone who has a phone, watches movies, and has friends. It provides lots of value to people who like to watch and discuss movies with their friends.
